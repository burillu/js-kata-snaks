### snack 1
Alice and Bob have participated to a Rock Off with their bands. A jury of true metalheads rates the two challenges, awarding points to the bands on a scale from 1 to 50 for three categories: Song Heaviness, Originality, and Members' outfits.

For each one of these 3 categories they are going to be awarded one point, should they get a better judgement from the jury. No point is awarded in case of an equal vote.

You are going to receive two arrays, containing first the score of Alice's band and then those of Bob's. Your task is to find their total score by comparing them in a single line.

Example:

Alice's band plays a Nirvana inspired grunge and has been rated 20 for Heaviness, 32 for Originality and only 18 for Outfits. Bob listens to Slayer and has gotten a good 48 for Heaviness, 25 for Originality and a rather honest 40 for Outfits.

The total score should be followed by a colon : and by one of the following quotes: if Alice's band wins: Alice made "Kurt" proud! if Bob's band wins: Bob made "Jeff" proud! if they end up with a draw: that looks like a "draw"! Rock on!

The solution to the example above should therefore appear like '1, 2: Bob made "Jeff" proud!'.

### snack 2

Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.


### snack 3

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces. 


### snack 4

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.

Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.

Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

### snack 5

Define a function that removes duplicates from an array of non negative numbers and returns it as a result.

The order of the sequence has to stay the same.

Examples:
```bash 
Input -> Output
[1, 1, 2] -> [1, 2]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2] -> [1, 2, 3]
```
